# Timer Overlay App Built with Electron.js and React.js

## About:

I created this timer-app to help me track down how much time I spend on coding tasks. Being able to use the app while utilizing my entire screen was a priority that's why I opted for creating an overlay mode that makes the app visible but allows me to click through it. Entering and exiting overlay is done with hotkeys.

### Regular Mode:

## Features: 
- Input the desired time to be counted down from.
- Overlay mode activated with hotkey "control/command + 6"

- An alarm sound.
